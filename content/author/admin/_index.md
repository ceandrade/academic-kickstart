Carlos Eduardo de Andrade is Senior Inventive Scientist at
[AT&T Labs Research](http://www.research.att.com).
He is interested in the application of exact algorithms
([mixed integer based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming))
and heuristics like
[genetic algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm),
[variable neighborhood search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_neighborhood_search),
and others, to deal with real large-scale problems in network design and
orchestration/operation (including
[Software-Defined Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking)).
Several problems emerge in this context such as networking planning (several
[Steiner-tree-like problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner_tree_problem)),
physical and virtual resource location and deployment
([facility-location-like problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facility_location_problem))
used in
[network function virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_function_virtualization),
among others.
